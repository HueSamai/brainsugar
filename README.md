# THIS IS BRAIN

Brain is a compiler for the programming language SUGAR. Read SUGAR.md, on how to program in SUGAR.
Brain is also planned to support compiling FUDGE, in the future.

# PROJECT LAYOUT
- The 'src' directory contains all the source code.
- The 'code' directory contains all the sugar, bf, and fudge code.
- The '_COMPILE.bat' is what I use to compile my C, because I don't know how to use a Makefile or a CMakeList or whatever. You
- The '__DEPRECATED' directory, contains all the old sugar files, and src code. You can look at it if you want.
- The 'quark' directory contains all the headers, object files, and the library file for my codebase called 'quark'.
- 'SUGAR.md' describes all the syntax for SUGAR.
- The 'brain.exe' is the compiler. Run 'brain' for help on how to use it.
- The object files in the root directory, are just of the source C files.
